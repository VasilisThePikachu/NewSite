## [Space Station 14](https://spacestation14.com/)
Space Station 14 is a multiplayer open source game made in C# using the [Robust Toolbox](https://github.com/space-wizards/RobustToolbox) game engine.

I have been a maintainer since <time datetime="2024-03-18T00:00:00+01:00">March 18, 2024</time> (and Lead Maintainer since <time datetime="2025-03-01T00:00:00+01:00">March 3, 2025</time>) where my main work is reviewing pull requests, helping direct the game design and game security.

Space Station 14 is currently my main and most contributed to project.

## [Tor Relays](https://metrics.torproject.org/rs.html#search/contact:pikachu.systems%20)
I currently host 2 (Guard/Middle) Tor Relays that help people around censorship.

## Server Administration
I self-host a bunch of services for myself, and also have hosted a bunch of game servers (Minecraft, Space Station 14). I have quite a good knowledge of hosting tools on Linux

###### More to come when I have something to show off.
