## [Space Station 14](https://spacestation14.com/)
Space Station 14 is a multiplayer open source game made in C# using the [Robust Toolbox](https://github.com/space-wizards/RobustToolbox) game engine.

I have been a maintainer since <time datetime="2024-03-18T00:00:00+01:00">March 18, 2024</time> (and Lead Maintainer since <time datetime="2025-03-01T00:00:00+01:00">March 3, 2025</time>) where my main work is reviewing pull requests, helping direct the game design and game security.

I additionally also help manage the account and game infrastracture for the official services.

Space Station 14 is currently my main and most contributed to project.

## [dn42](https://dn42.eu/Home)
dn42 is a large, dynamic VPN that employs Internet technologies (BGP, whois database, DNS, etc.). Participants connect to each other using network tunnels (GRE, OpenVPN, WireGuard, Tinc, IPsec) and exchange routes using the Border Gateway Protocol.

In simpler words, it is a "darknet"[^1] where you get to play around with the tools real world ISP's use in order to let you use the internet and provide you with other services.

I manage [AS-ILLUMINATE (ASN4242421413)](https://dn42.g-load.eu/explorer/#/aut-num/AS4242421413) in reference after the Avali species.

[^1]: A darknet is an overlay network within the Internet that can only be accessed with specific software, configurations, or authorization ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darknet)). Not all darknets are for sinister purposes.

## [Tor Relays](https://metrics.torproject.org/rs.html#search/contact:pikachu.systems%20)
I used to host 2 (Guard/Middle) Tor Relays that helped people around censorship. Sadly they got shutdown by Oracle since I was sapping their free services just for this :3
