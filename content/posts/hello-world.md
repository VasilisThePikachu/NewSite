So guys, we did it.

<!--more-->

## So what is new?

Well... this blog to begin with. That's right I have a blog now. Don't expect anything soon, it also has RSS.

I am now using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to generate this website instead of using PURE html.

The background is a bit less dark for dark mode and now supports light mode as well with ``prefers-color-scheme``.

A bunch of css and hugo shit was stolen from my [friend PJB](https://slugcat.systems/) cause this shit is scary. I did some stuff myself too though. 

I added myself to the furryring and made a fediring selector. 

Javascript is scary.

I got a projects tab now where I'm gonna add anything new I wanna show off.

Kind of changed the main home page to be less "I wrote this page in 2022"
