Hello! I'm Myra and welcome to my personal blog thingy.

### Bit about me

I am a self taught programmer and system admin, I tend to enjoy interacting with computers and related topics a lot.

My primary project currently is [Space Station 14](https://spacestation14.com/).

I'm Pansexual and Genderfluid. I go by any pronouns but usually default to she/her.

I am a furry, an Avali to be specific. 

I like Pikachu a lot. Which is why I kinda branded this site after this mouse.

### What to expect here

Mostly just me showing off my [projects/what I work on](/projects). And the occasional blog post on the side.
