Hello! I'm Myra and welcome to my personal webpage/blog thingy.

### Bit about me

I'm Pansexual and Genderfluid. I go by any pronouns.

I am a furry, I will at some point make a separate page about my sonas.

I like Pikachu WAYY too much.

### What to expect here

Mostly just me showing off my projects/what I work off. And the occasional blog post on the side.
