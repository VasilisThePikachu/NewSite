Hello! I'm Myra and welcome to my personal blog thingy.

### Bit about me

I'm Pansexual and Genderfluid. I go by any pronouns.

I am a furry, an Avali to be specific. 

I like Pikachu a lot. Which is why I kinda branded this site after this mouse.

### What to expect here

Mostly just me showing off my projects/what I work off. And the occasional blog post on the side.
